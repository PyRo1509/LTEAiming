This script was developed on a GL.iNet X750 device utilizing a Verizon SIM card. Initially, it functioned as intended, seamlessly retrieving data via the "uqmi" calls, which fetch information from the modem. However, subsequent executions encountered a recurring issue where the script would hang during these "uqmi" calls. Notably, disconnecting from the cell tower within the GL.iNet GUI alleviated this problem, freeing the modem to respond to the "uqmi" requests.

Please ensure to grant executable permissions to the script by running chmod +x Monitor_RSSI.sh to facilitate its execution.
